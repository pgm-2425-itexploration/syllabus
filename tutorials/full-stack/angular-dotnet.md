## What's the Difference? .NET, ASP.NET, and ASP.NET Core

Before we dive in, it's important to clarify the terminology, as it can be confusing for newcomers:

- **.NET** is the overall development platform from Microsoft. It supports building all kinds of applications (web, desktop, mobile, cloud, etc.) and is the foundation for everything else.
- **ASP.NET** is the original web framework for .NET, released in the early 2000s. It is Windows-only and sometimes called "ASP.NET Framework" or "ASP.NET MVC."
- **ASP.NET Core** is the modern, cross-platform version of ASP.NET. It was introduced in 2016, is open source, runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is much faster and more modular. Today, when people talk about building web APIs or web apps with .NET, they almost always mean **ASP.NET Core**.

**In this tutorial, we focus on building a full-stack application with Angular (frontend) and ASP.NET Core (backend).**

# Angular + ASP.NET Core: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

Angular and ASP.NET Core are a great match when it comes to building modern web apps. Angular, made by Google, helps you create fast and interactive single-page applications (SPAs) on the front end. On the back end, you've got ASP.NET Core from Microsoft, a flexible, cross-platform framework that's perfect for building APIs and web services.

Together, they offer a solid setup that's popular in the real world. Thanks to the clean separation between front and back ends, their scalability, and all the helpful tools they come with. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to build a simple full-stack app using both technologies. We'll keep things beginner-friendly, so you don't need a complex backend or database to follow along.

### Why Angular + ASP.NET Core?

- **Scalability**: Both frameworks are suitable for small and large projects.
- **Community and support**: Angular and ASP.NET Core have large, active communities and extensive documentation.
- **Separation of concerns**: You can develop and deploy frontend and backend independently.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for web apps, mobile apps (with Ionic or MAUI), and even desktop apps.

### Who is this tutorial for?

This tutorial is for developers who want to learn how to build a modern web application with Angular and ASP.NET Core, without immediately setting up complex infrastructure. You need basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and optionally C#, but everything is explained step by step.

**What will you learn?**

- How to set up and connect an Angular frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend
- Implementing CRUD functionality
- UX improvements and validation
- Best practices for project structure, security, and performance
- How to expand your app with fun features
- And more!

## Installation

Good preparation is half the battle. In this section, we explain which tools you need, how to install them, and how to set up your first projects.

### Requirements

- **Node.js (v18+)**: For running Angular and managing packages.
- **.NET SDK (v8+)**: For building and running the backend.
- **Angular CLI**: Command-line tool to quickly generate Angular projects.
- **Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider**: Modern code editors with great support for Angular and .NET.

#### Why these tools?

- **Node.js** is the runtime for JavaScript outside the browser and essential for modern web development.
- **.NET SDK** provides everything you need to build C# applications, including a powerful CLI.
- **Angular CLI** speeds up your workflow: you can create new components, services, and more in seconds.
- **VS Code** is lightweight, free, and has countless extensions for Angular, .NET, Git, and more.

### Steps

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)  
   Check installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   You should see the installed version. Version 18 or higher is recommended.

2. **Install .NET SDK**  
   Download from [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
   Check installation:

   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

   You should see the installed version. Version 8 or higher is recommended.

3. **Install Angular CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ng version
   ```

   This installs the CLI globally. Check with `ng version` if everything works.

4. **Create projects**

   ```bash
   ng new angular-dotnet-frontend
   dotnet new webapi -n angular-dotnet-backend
   ```

   For Angular, choose routing (Yes) and SCSS or CSS as stylesheet.

5. **Project structure**
   <!-- Project structure image removed - file not found -->
   You now have two folders: one for the frontend and one for the backend. This makes it easy to develop and test both parts separately.

#### Extra tips

- Install the Angular Language Service extension in VS Code for better autocompletion.
- Use Git from the start to track your progress.
- Prefer working online? Try [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) for Angular or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Configuration

In this chapter, you'll learn how to configure the Angular frontend and ASP.NET Core backend so they work well together. We cover setting up both projects, enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in .NET, and setting up a proxy in Angular so your frontend can easily communicate with your backend during development.

### 1. Setting up the Angular frontend

Navigate to your frontend project folder:

```bash
cd angular-dotnet-frontend
```

Start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

By default, this runs on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

#### Angular project structure

- **src/app/**: Your components, services, and modules.
- **src/assets/**: For images, icons, and other static files.
- **angular.json**: Project configuration.
- **package.json**: Manages dependencies and scripts.

### 2. Setting up the ASP.NET Core backend

Open a new terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd Angular-dotnet-backend
```

Start the .NET Web API:

```bash
dotnet run
```

By default, this runs on [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001) (or port 5000 for http). **Note:** Your system might use different ports (like 5195, 7000, etc.). Check the console output when you run `dotnet run` to see the actual URLs.

#### ASP.NET Core project structure

- **Controllers/**: Your API controllers.
- **Program.cs**: Entry point of your application.
- **appsettings.json**: Configuration files.

### 3. Enabling CORS in .NET

To allow requests from your Angular frontend, you need to enable CORS in your .NET backend. Open `Program.cs` in your backend project and add the following:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Enable CORS for Angular development server
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowAngularDev",
        policy => policy.WithOrigins("http://localhost:4200")
                        .AllowAnyHeader()
                        .AllowAnyMethod());
});

var app = builder.Build();

// Use the CORS policy
app.UseCors("AllowAngularDev");

// ... your endpoints and app.Run() ...
```

This allows your Angular app to send requests to your .NET API during development.

### 4. Setting up a proxy in Angular

To avoid CORS issues during development, you can set up a proxy in Angular. In the root of your Angular project, create a file called `proxy.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "https://localhost:5000",
    "secure": false,
    "changeOrigin": true,
    "logLevel": "debug"
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `5000` with the actual port your .NET backend is running on (check your console output when you run `dotnet run`).

Then update your `angular.json` so your Angular server uses this proxy:

```json
"serve": {
  "options": {
    "proxyConfig": "proxy.conf.json"
  }
}
```

Now start your Angular app with:

```bash
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```

You can now make API calls to `/api/...` in your Angular code, and these will be automatically forwarded to your .NET backend.

### 5. Project structure diagram

Below is a diagram of the typical project structure:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[angular-dotnet-frontend (Angular)] -- API calls --> B[angular-dotnet-backend (.NET Web API)]
  B -- Data --> C[(Database)]
```

#### Extra tips

- Use environment files (`environment.ts`) in Angular to manage API URLs and settings.
- Run your backend on a different port if you encounter conflicts.
- Use HTTPS for your backend to avoid issues with modern browsers.

## Core Functionality

In this chapter, we'll build the core of our full-stack application: a simple to-do list app where you can create, view, update, and delete tasks (CRUD). We'll cover both the backend (API in .NET) and the frontend (Angular), and show how they communicate.

### 1. Designing the data model

#### .NET (C#) - Model

For this simple demo, the data model is defined directly in the backend's `Program.cs` file as a C# record:

```csharp
// Program.cs (at the bottom)
record TaskItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each task.
- **Title**: The name or description of the task.
- **IsCompleted**: Whether the task is completed.

> In larger projects, you would typically place models in a separate Models folder, but for this tutorial, everything is kept in one file for simplicity.

### 2. Building the API in .NET

All API logic is contained in a single file: Program.cs. This keeps the project simple and easy to follow. Normally in big projects, you would use more files to keep things clean!

```csharp
// Program.cs

// Simple .NET backend for a task list (no database)
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using System.Collections.Generic;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// CORS for Angular frontend
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowAngularDev",
        policy => policy.WithOrigins("http://localhost:4200")
                        .AllowAnyHeader()
                        .AllowAnyMethod());
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseCors("AllowAngularDev");

// In-memory list of tasks


var tasks = new List<TaskItem>();

// Get all tasks
app.MapGet("/api/tasks", () => tasks);

// Add a new task
app.MapPost("/api/tasks", (TaskItem task) =>
{
    task.Id = tasks.Count > 0 ? tasks[^1].Id + 1 : 1;
    tasks.Add(task);
    return Results.Created($"/api/tasks/{task.Id}", task);
});

// Update a task
app.MapPut("/api/tasks/{id}", (int id, TaskItem updatedTask) =>
{
    var task = tasks.Find(t => t.Id == id);
    if (task is null) return Results.NotFound();
    task.Title = updatedTask.Title;
    task.IsCompleted = updatedTask.IsCompleted;
    return Results.NoContent();
});

// Delete a task
app.MapDelete("/api/tasks/{id}", (int id) =>
{
    var task = tasks.Find(t => t.Id == id);
    if (task is null) return Results.NotFound();
    tasks.Remove(task);
    return Results.NoContent();
});

app.Run();

// Simple task model
record TaskItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **GET**: Retrieves all tasks.
- **POST**: Adds a new task.
- **PUT**: Updates an existing task.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a task.

> **Tip:** In production, use a database (like SQLite, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL) instead of a static list. For this tutorial, we keep it simple.

### 3. Angular frontend: service and component

#### Service for API communication

```typescript
// src/app/services/task.service.ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

export interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class TaskService {
  private apiUrl = "/api/tasks";

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
    return this.http.get<Task[]>(this.apiUrl);
  }

  addTask(task: Partial<Task>): Observable<Task> {
    return this.http.post<Task>(this.apiUrl, task);
  }

  updateTask(task: Task): Observable<void> {
    return this.http.put<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/${task.id}`, task);
  }

  deleteTask(id: number): Observable<void> {
    return this.http.delete<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/${id}`);
  }
}
```

#### Component for the task list

```typescript
// src/app/components/task-list/task-list.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { Task, TaskService } from "../../services/task.service";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

@Component({
  selector: "app-task-list",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
})
export class TaskListComponent implements OnInit {
  tasks: Task[] = [];
  newTaskTitle = "";

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.loadTasks();
  }

  loadTasks() {
    this.taskService.getTasks().subscribe((tasks) => (this.tasks = tasks));
  }

  addTask() {
    if (!this.newTaskTitle.trim()) return;
    this.taskService
      .addTask({ title: this.newTaskTitle, isCompleted: false })
      .subscribe(() => {
        this.newTaskTitle = "";
        this.loadTasks();
      });
  }

  updateTask(task: Task) {
    this.taskService.updateTask(task).subscribe();
  }

  deleteTask(id: number) {
    this.taskService.deleteTask(id).subscribe(() => this.loadTasks());
  }
}
```

#### Template (HTML)

```html
<!-- src/app/components/task-list/task-list.component.html -->
<div class="task-list-container">
  <h2>My Task List</h2>
  <p>
    Add tasks, check them off, or delete them. Everything happens directly in
    the server's memory (no database).
  </p>

  <form (submit)="addTask(); $event.preventDefault()">
    <input
      type="text"
      [(ngModel)]="newTaskTitle"
      name="newTaskTitle"
      placeholder="E.g.: Buy groceries"
      required
    />
    <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
  </form>

  <ul *ngIf="tasks.length > 0; else noTasks">
    <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        [(ngModel)]="task.isCompleted"
        (change)="updateTask(task)"
      />
      <span [ngClass]="{ completed: task.isCompleted }">{{ task.title }}</span>
      <button (click)="deleteTask(task.id)">Delete Task</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ng-template #noTasks>
    <p>No tasks found. Add one!</p>
  </ng-template>

  <footer
    style="margin-top:2rem; text-align:center; color:#888; font-size:0.9em;"
  >
    <hr />
    <p>Demo app without a database, for explanation and testing only.</p>
  </footer>
</div>

<style>
  .task-list-container {
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: 2rem auto;
    padding: 1rem;
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);
  }
  .task-list-container h2 {
    text-align: center;
  }
  .task-list-container form {
    display: flex;
    gap: 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
  }
  .task-list-container ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
  }
  .task-list-container li {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.5rem;
    padding: 0.25rem 0;
  }
  .completed {
    text-decoration: line-through;
    color: #888;
  }
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

- **ngOnInit**: Loads the tasks when the page opens.
- **addTask**: Adds a new task via the API.
- **updateTask**: Updates the status of a task.
- **deleteTask**: Deletes a task.

#### Extra: Styling and UX

- Use clear buttons and labels.
- Add animations when adding/removing tasks.
- Make your app responsive with CSS Flexbox or Grid.

### 4. Testing the core functionality

- Start both the backend (`dotnet run`) and the frontend (`ng serve`).
- Open the Angular app in your browser and test adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Check the backend console to see if API calls are coming through correctly.
- Try edge cases: adding an empty task, task name too short, etc.

---

## Advanced Features

In this chapter, we go beyond the basics and add extra features that make your app more fun, user-friendly, and modern. We keep it accessible: you don't need a database or complex backend. All examples are directly applicable in your own project!

### 1. Validation and User Experience (UX)

#### Form validation in Angular

A good user experience starts with clear feedback. In Angular, you can easily add validation to your input fields:

```html
<!-- In task-list.component.html -->
<input
  [(ngModel)]="newTaskTitle"
  placeholder="New task..."
  required
  minlength="3"
  #titleInput="ngModel"
/>
<button (click)="addTask()" [disabled]="titleInput.invalid">Add</button>
<div *ngIf="titleInput.invalid && titleInput.touched" class="error">
  The task must be at least 3 characters long.
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- With `required` and `minlength`, you validate directly in the template.
- With `#titleInput="ngModel"`, you can read the validation status.
- Show an error message if the field is invalid and the user has touched it.

#### Visual feedback and animations

Make your app more lively with simple CSS animations:
(Remove current CSS for better outcome)

```css
/* Modern, elegant styling for the task list */

  --primary: #6366f1;
  --primary-hover: #4f46e5;

### 2. Saving tasks in localStorage

Want your to-do list to persist after refreshing the page? Use localStorage instead of a backend!

#### Service for localStorage

```typescript
// src/app/services/task.service.ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Observable, of } from "rxjs";

export interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class TaskService {
  private storageKey = "tasks";

  constructor() {}

  getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
    const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.storageKey) || "[]");
    return of(tasks);
  }

  addTask(task: Partial<Task>): Observable<Task> {
    const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.storageKey) || "[]");

    const newTask: Task = {
      ...task,
      id: Date.now(),
      title: task.title || "",
      isCompleted: false,
    };
    tasks.push(newTask);
    localStorage.setItem(this.storageKey, JSON.stringify(tasks));
    return of(newTask);
  }

  updateTask(task: Task): Observable<void> {
    let tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.storageKey) || "[]");
    tasks = tasks.map((t: Task) => (t.id === task.id ? task : t));
    localStorage.setItem(this.storageKey, JSON.stringify(tasks));
    return of();
  }

  deleteTask(id: number): Observable<void> {
    let tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(this.storageKey) || "[]");
    tasks = tasks.filter((t: Task) => t.id !== id);
    localStorage.setItem(this.storageKey, JSON.stringify(tasks));
    return of();
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Tasks are now stored in the browser, so you don't need a backend.
- Perfect for demos, prototypes, or small personal tools.
- You can extend this approach with extra fields, like deadlines or priority.

### 3. Themes and dark mode

Make your app more personal with a light/dark theme!

```css
/* styles.css */
body.dark {
  background: #222;
  color: #eee;
}
body.dark input,
body.dark button {
  background: #333;
  color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #444;
}
```

```typescript
// In your main component (e.g., app.component.ts)
toggleTheme() {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
}
```

```html
<!-- In app.component.html -->
<button (click)="toggleTheme()">Toggle theme</button>
```

**Explanation:**

- With one line of code, you can switch between light and dark.
- You can store the theme in localStorage so the preference is saved.

### 4. Simple animations with Angular

Use Angular's animation library for smooth transitions:

```typescript
// In your component
import { trigger, transition, style, animate } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  // ...
  animations: [
    trigger('fadeInOut', [
      transition(':enter', [style({ opacity: 0 }), animate('300ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))]),
      transition(':leave', [animate('300ms', style({ opacity: 0 }))]),
    ]),
  ],
})
```

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks" [@fadeInOut]>
    <!-- ... -->
  </li>
</ul>
```

**Explanation:**

- Angular animations are powerful and declarative.
- You can combine animations with Angular's *ngIf and *ngFor for dynamic lists.

## Best practices

A good codebase is not only functional, but also maintainable, readable, and extensible. Below are best practices you can apply, even in small projects without a backend or database.

### 1. Structure and organization

- **Split your code into components**: Create a separate Angular component for each logical unit. This keeps your code organized and reusable.
- **Use services for logic**: Place logic for data storage, filtering, or API calls in separate services. This keeps your components clean.
- **Clear folder structure**: Use folders like `components/`, `services/`, and `assets/` for components, services, and images respectively.
- **Document your code**: Add JSDoc or TypeDoc comments to important functions and classes.

### 2. Write clear and consistent code

- **Use TypeScript types**: Define interfaces for your data (like `Task`). This prevents errors and makes your code predictable.
- **Consistent naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
- **Format your code**: Use a formatter like Prettier or the built-in VS Code formatter.
- **Use linters**: Tools like ESLint and TSLint help you catch errors and inconsistencies early.

### 3. UX and accessibility

- **Accessible HTML**: Use semantic HTML and make sure your app is usable with keyboard and screen reader.
- **User feedback**: Show error messages, loading indicators, and confirmations for actions.
- **Responsive design**: Make sure your app works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Contrast and readability**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background, especially in dark mode.

### 4. Use version control

- **Git**: Always use version control, even for small projects. Make regular commits with clear messages.
- **.gitignore**: Add a `.gitignore` to keep build files, node_modules, and sensitive data out of your repo.
- **Branches**: Work with feature branches for larger additions or experiments.

### 5. Keep it fun!

- Experiment with animations, colors, and small interactions.
- Add easter eggs or small surprises for the user.
- Share your project with others and ask for feedback.
- Organize a code review with a friend or colleague.

## Deep Dive: Component-based development in Angular

One of Angular's greatest strengths is its component-based development model. Instead of one big HTML page, you build your app from small, reusable building blocks: components. Each component has its own template, logic, and styling. This makes it easy to maintain, extend, and test your app.

### What is a component?

A component is a TypeScript class with an HTML template and optionally a CSS stylesheet. For example:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-greeting",
  template: `<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>`,
  styles: [
    `
      h1 {
        color: #007bff;
      }
    `,
  ],
})
export class GreetingComponent {
  name = "developer";
}
```

You use this component in another template with `<app-greeting></app-greeting>`.

### Benefits

- **Reusability**: Build a button, card, or form once and use it everywhere.
- **Testability**: Small components are easier to test.
- **Scalability**: Large apps remain manageable.

### Practical tips

- Keep components small and focused on one task.
- Use input/output properties to exchange data between components.
- Use services for shared logic or data.

## TypeScript: Angular's superpower

Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript with types. This helps you catch errors early, better document your code, and improve tooling.

### Why TypeScript?

- **Type safety**: Fewer bugs due to type checks while coding.
- **Better autocompletion**: Your editor knows exactly which properties and methods are available.
- **Modern JavaScript**: TypeScript supports the latest JS features, even if browsers don't yet.

### Example

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}

function completeTask(task: Task): Task {
  return { ...task, isCompleted: true };
}
```

---

## REST API design and alternatives

Most web apps communicate with a backend via a REST API. But there are alternatives!

### REST

- **Resources**: Everything is a resource (e.g., /tasks, /users).
- **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all the info needed.

### GraphQL

- One endpoint, flexible queries.
- You only request the data you need.
- Popular in large apps with many different data types.

### gRPC

- Uses protocol buffers (faster, more compact).
- Ideal for microservices and real-time communication.

### When to choose what?

- **REST**: Simple, widely supported, easy to debug.
- **GraphQL**: Complex data, many clients, need for flexible queries.
- **gRPC**: High performance, internal communication between services.

---

## Security basics for web apps

Security is essential, even for small projects!

### Key points

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Use Angular's data binding, avoid `innerHTML`.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Use tokens for sensitive actions.
- **CORS**: Only allow trusted origins.
- **Sensitive data**: Never store passwords or tokens in localStorage without encryption.

### Extra tips

- Use Angular's built-in sanitization.
- Update dependencies regularly.
- Use environment variables for secrets.

---

## Testing in Angular and ASP.NET Core

Testing ensures reliability and confidence in your code.

### Angular

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and components with Jasmine/Karma.
- **End-to-end tests**: Test the entire app with Cypress or Protractor.

### ASP.NET Core

- **Unit tests**: Use xUnit or NUnit for C#.
- **Integration tests**: Test API endpoints with an in-memory server.

### Example Angular unit test

```typescript
describe("TaskService", () => {
  it("should add a task", () => {
    const service = new TaskService();
    service.addTask({ title: "Test", isCompleted: false }).subscribe((task) => {
      expect(task.title).toBe("Test");
    });
  });
});
```

## The History and Evolution of Angular and ASP.NET Core

Understanding the background of the tools you use can help you appreciate their strengths and design decisions. Both Angular and ASP.NET Core have rich histories and have evolved significantly over time.

### Angular

Angular was first released by Google in 2010 as "AngularJS" (version 1.x). It was a revolutionary framework for building dynamic web applications using two-way data binding and dependency injection. However, as web standards and developer needs evolved, the Angular team decided to rewrite the framework from scratch. In 2016, "Angular" (sometimes called Angular 2+) was released, offering a component-based architecture, TypeScript support, improved performance, and a more modern development experience. Since then, Angular has seen regular updates, introducing features like Ivy (a new rendering engine), standalone components, and improved tooling.

### ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core was introduced in 2016 as a modern, cross-platform version of ASP.NET. It was open source, runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is much faster and more modular. Today, ASP.NET Core is the primary way to build web APIs and web apps with .NET.
