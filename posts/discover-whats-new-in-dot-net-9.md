## New in .NET9

### Feature Switches with trimming

Feature switches with trimming allow you to enable or disable specific features in your application, which can then be trimmed out of the final build if they are not used. This helps in reducing the size of your application and improving performance. Two key attributes are used:

- FeatureSwitchDefinitionAttribute: Marks a feature switch property as a constant during trimming. If a feature is turned off, the related code is removed.
- FeatureGuardAttribute: Ensures that certain code only runs if the runtime environment supports it, working with attributes like RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute2.

### Base6Url

The Base64Url type in .NET 9 provides a way to encode binary data into URL-safe ASCII text. Unlike traditional Base64 encoding, which can include characters like /, +, and =, Base64Url avoids these characters, making the encoded data safe for use in URLs without additional encoding steps. This is particularly useful for web applications that need to include binary data in URLs4.

### System.Linq additions

.NET 9 introduces several new methods to the LINQ (Language Integrated Query) library, enhancing its functionality:

- Index: Allows you to traverse a collection while obtaining both the index and value of each element.
- CountBy: Groups elements by a selector function and returns an enumeration of KeyValuePairs, where the key is the object and the value is the count of elements in the group.
- AggregateBy: Similar to CountBy, but instead of counting, it aggregates elements using a provided seed and aggregation function

### Generic OrderedDictionary

The Generic OrderedDictionary is a new collection type that combines the features of a dictionary and a list. It maintains the order of elements while allowing for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions. This is particularly useful when you need to preserve the order of items while still benefiting from the fast access times of a dictionary.

### PriorityQueue. Remove

The PriorityQueue.Remove method allows you to remove specific items from a priority queue. A priority queue is a data structure that always returns the highest-priority element first. This new method enhances the flexibility of priority queues by allowing you to remove elements based on certain conditions.

### ReadOnlySet

The ReadOnlySet is a new collection type that represents a set that cannot be modified after creation. This is useful for scenarios where you need to ensure that the collection remains unchanged, providing better data integrity and safety.

### System.Text.Json additions

.NET 9 brings several enhancements to the System.Text.Json namespace, making JSON serialization and deserialization more powerful and flexible:

- Polymorphic Serialization: Improved support for polymorphic types, allowing you to serialize and deserialize objects of derived types more easily.
- Custom Converters: Enhanced custom converter support, enabling more complex scenarios and better control over the serialization process.
- Source Generators: Improved source generators for JSON serialization, which can significantly boost performance by generating optimized serialization code at compile time.
- New Attributes: Additional attributes for fine-tuning JSON serialization behavior, such as JsonDerivedTypeAttribute and JsonPolymorphicAttribute.

### TimeSpan from overloads

The TimeSpan structure in .NET 9 introduces new overloads for creating instances, making it more intuitive and flexible to work with time intervals. These overloads allow you to create TimeSpan objects using different units of time, such as days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

### Task.WhenEach

The Task.WhenEach method is a new addition to the Task class that allows you to await multiple tasks individually, rather than waiting for all tasks to complete. This can be useful for handling asynchronous operations more efficiently, especially when you need to process the results of each task as soon as it completes.

### Compression options

.NET 9 introduces enhanced compression options to optimize the size and performance of your applications. The new static asset delivery optimization feature uses Brotli and Gzip compression to reduce static web asset file sizes by over 80%. This is particularly beneficial for users on slower networks, as it significantly reduces response times. The compressed files are generated at build time, and separate compressed files are added to your static web assets when the project is compiled.

### BinaryFormatter removal

Starting with .NET 9, the BinaryFormatter class has been removed from the runtime due to its security risks. The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception. Developers are encouraged to migrate away from BinaryFormatter and use safer serialization methods. If you still need to use BinaryFormatter, you can depend on the unsupported System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters NuGet package, which restores the legacy functionality.

### SearchValues expansion

The SearchValues type, introduced in .NET 8, has been expanded in .NET 9 to support searching for substrings within a larger string. This type provides an optimized solution for searching specific sets of characters or bytes within spans. The new overloads allow you to search for string values within other text, making it more versatile and efficient for various search scenarios.

### GeneratedRegEx on properties

The GeneratedRegex attribute can now be used on properties in .NET 9. This feature allows you to define regular expressions directly on properties, making it easier to validate and manipulate data. By using this attribute, you can generate efficient and reusable regular expressions at compile time, improving performance and reducing runtime errors.

### RegEx Enumeratesplits

The Regex.EnumerateSplits method is a new addition to the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace. This method allows you to split a string using a regular expression and iterate over the resulting segments. Unlike the traditional Split method, EnumerateSplits provides a more efficient way to handle large strings by avoiding the creation of intermediate arrays.

### System. Security Cryptography additions

.NET 9 introduces several enhancements to the System.Security.Cryptography namespace, providing new cryptographic features and improvements:

- ChaCha20-Poly1305: A new authenticated encryption algorithm that combines the ChaCha20 stream cipher with the Poly1305 message authentication code. This algorithm is known for its performance and security.
- XChaCha20-Poly1305: An extended version of ChaCha20-Poly1305 that supports longer nonces, providing better security for certain use cases.
- SHA-3: Support for the SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash functions, including SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512. These hash functions offer improved security over the older SHA-2 family.

### Guid Createversion7

The Guid.CreateVersion7 method allows you to create version 7 GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). Version 7 GUIDs are based on timestamps, which makes them sortable by creation time. This is particularly useful for databases and other systems where the order of creation is important. The method can be used with or without a DateTimeOffset parameter:

- Guid.CreateVersion7(): Creates a new GUID based on the current timestamp.
- Guid.CreateVersion7(DateTimeOffset timestamp): Creates a new GUID based on the provided timestamp.

### ActivatorUtiltes Createlnstance fix

The ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance method has been improved to behave more consistently. This method is used to instantiate types with constructor arguments provided directly and/or from an IServiceProvider. The fix ensures that the method now prefers the longest constructor overload that has all its arguments available, making it more reliable and predictable.

### Debug.Assert reports

The Debug.Assert method has been enhanced to provide more detailed reports when an assertion fails. This method is used to check for conditions that are expected to be true during development. If the condition is false, it outputs messages and displays a message box showing the call stack. The improvements in .NET 9 make it easier to diagnose and fix issues by providing more context and information about the failure.

### TarEntry.DataOffset

The TarEntry.DataOffset property is a new addition in .NET 9 that provides the starting position of the data stream relative to the archive stream. This is particularly useful when working with TAR archives, as it allows you to determine the exact position of the data within the archive. If the entry does not come from an archive stream or if the archive stream is not seekable, the property returns -1. This feature enhances the ability to manipulate and extract data from TAR files more efficiently.

### Debugging for Dictionaries

.NET 9 introduces improved debugging support for dictionaries and other key-value collections. The debugging display of dictionaries now has an improved layout, where the key is displayed in the debugger's key column instead of being concatenated with the value. This makes it easier to inspect and troubleshoot dictionary contents during development. Additionally, the new `GetAlternateLookup<TKey, TValue, TAlternate>` method allows for more efficient lookups using alternate keys, such as ReadOnlySpan `<char>`, without the need for string allocations.

## New in C#13

### Params Collections

In C# 13, the params modifier is no longer limited to array types. You can now use params with any recognized collection type, such as `System.Span<T>`, `System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`, and types that implement `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>` and have an Add method2. This enhancement allows for more flexible and efficient method calls. This feature improves performance by allowing the compiler to create the collection directly on the stack, avoiding heap allocations.

### New Lock object

The new System.Threading.Lock type in .NET 9 provides better thread synchronization through its API3. The Lock.EnterScope() method enters an exclusive scope, and the ref struct returned from that supports the Dispose() pattern to exit the exclusive scope. The C# lock statement recognizes if the target of the lock is a Lock object and uses the EnterScope method under the hood. This new lock type offers improved performance and safety compared to traditional monitor-based locking.

### New escape sequence

C# 13 introduces a new escape sequence \e as a shortcut for the character code point 0x1b, commonly known as the ESCAPE (or ESC) character4. Previously, this character was accessible using escape sequences like \u001b, \U0000001b, or \x1b. The new \e escape sequence simplifies the inclusion of the ESC character in strings and character literals. This addition is particularly useful when working with terminals and ANSI escape codes.

### Implicit index access

Implicit index access simplifies the syntax for accessing elements in collections using indices. Instead of explicitly specifying the index, you can use the ^ operator to access elements from the end of the collection. This feature makes your code more concise and readable.

### More partial members

C# 13 expands support for partial members, allowing you to split the implementation of classes, structs, and interfaces across multiple files. This feature is particularly useful for large projects, as it helps organize code more effectively and improves maintainability. You can now define partial methods with bodies, partial properties, and partial events.

### ref and unsafe in Iterators and Async methods

C# 13 introduces support for ref and unsafe in iterators and async methods, providing more flexibility and control over memory management. This feature allows you to use ref returns and parameters, as well as unsafe code, in methods that use yield or async.

### ref struct interfaces

In C# 13, ref struct types can now implement interfaces. This feature allows you to define interfaces that can be implemented by ref struct types, providing more flexibility and enabling better design patterns when working with value types. ref struct types are stack-allocated and cannot be boxed, which makes them more efficient for certain scenarios.

### ref struct Type arguments

C# 13 also introduces support for using ref struct types as type arguments in generic types and methods. This feature allows you to create more flexible and reusable code by using ref struct types in generic contexts.

## New in ASP.NET9

### Improved debugging support

ASP.NET 9 introduces enhanced debugging support, making it easier to inspect and troubleshoot your applications. One significant improvement is the better layout for dictionaries and key-value collections in the debugger. This enhancement allows you to see the keys and values more clearly, making it easier to understand the data structures during development. Additionally, the debugging experience has been streamlined to provide more detailed and useful information when assertions fail, helping you diagnose and fix issues more efficiently.

### SignalR

SignalR in ASP.NET 9 brings several new features and improvements for real-time web functionality. Some key updates include:

- Polymorphic Type Support: SignalR Hubs can now accept a base class instead of the derived class, enabling polymorphic scenarios. This allows for more flexible and reusable code when working with SignalR.
- Improved Connection Management: SignalR handles connection management automatically, making it easier to manage connections, groups, and messaging between clients and servers.
- Scalability Enhancements: SignalR has been optimized to handle increasing traffic, ensuring that your real-time applications can scale efficiently.

### Blazor component constructor injection

Blazor in ASP.NET 9 now supports constructor injection for components, providing a more intuitive and efficient way to inject dependencies. Constructor injection allows you to define dependencies directly in the component's constructor, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Blazor WebSocket compression

In ASP.NET 9, Blazor introduces WebSocket compression for interactive server components. This feature enables compression for WebSocket connections by default, which helps reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, improving performance and reducing latency. You can control this behavior using the DisableWebSocketCompression option. For example, to disable WebSocket compression, you can set this option to true. This feature is particularly useful for applications that rely heavily on real-time communication, as it can significantly enhance the user experience by making interactions faster and more responsive.

### Developer Exception page

The Developer Exception Page in ASP.NET 9 provides detailed information about unhandled request exceptions. It uses DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware to capture synchronous and asynchronous exceptions from the HTTP pipeline and generate error responses. This page runs early in the middleware pipeline, ensuring that it can catch exceptions thrown in subsequent middleware.

The Developer Exception Page includes information such as:

- Stack trace
- Query string parameters
- Cookies
- Headers
- Endpoint metadata

This detailed information helps developers diagnose and fix issues more efficiently. The Developer Exception Page is enabled by default when the application is running in the Development environment. It's important to note that the Developer Exception Page should only be enabled in the Development environment to avoid exposing sensitive information in production

### InternalServerError TypedResult

The InternalServerError method in ASP.NET 9 is part of the TypedResults class, which provides a strongly-typed way to create HTTP responses. The InternalServerError method produces a Status500InternalServerError response, indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. There are two overloads for this method:

- `InternalServerError()`: Produces a Status500InternalServerError response without any additional content.
- `InternalServerError<TValue>(TValue error)`: Produces a Status500InternalServerError response with a JSON-serialized error object in the response body.

This feature improves code readability, unit testing, and reduces the chance of runtime errors by providing strongly-typed objects for HTTP responses.

### Keyed DI in Middleware

Keyed Dependency Injection (DI) in middleware is a new feature in .NET 9 that allows you to inject specific services into middleware based on defined keys. This feature builds on the keyed services introduced in .NET 8, which allowed developers to register multiple instances of the same service type with distinct keys. In .NET 9, this capability is extended to middleware, making it easier to manage and inject specific services within middleware components.

## How to make a Blazor project

Starting a Blazor application involves setting up your development environment, creating a new Blazor project, and running it.

### 1. Install .NET SDK

Got to [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and download .NET 9.0.
Follow the installation steps.
![Steps on installing .NET9](/assets/posts/dotnet9-img2.png)

### 2. Create a new Blazor project

Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder where you want to add the Blazor WebAssembly project. Open a new terminal, and in the command line, execute:

```bash
dotnet new blazorwasm -o project-name
```

### 3. Start the Blazor application

Navigate to the project folder using the terminal and run the application:

```bash
cd project-name
dotnet run
```

The server is started on the URL provided. In the terminal, information is shown and here you can see on which URL the server is listening on. In this example it is ‚Äòhttp://localhost:5063‚Äô.

```bash
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5063
```

### 4. Customize and develop your application

Blazor apps use .razor files for pages. Routes are made in the folder ‚ÄòPages‚Äô. At the start of each file, ‚Äò@page ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äú is defined. This is the root for that file. For example, at the start of the index file `@page "/"` is added. Then, change the title of the page by added `<PageTitle>Index</PageTitle>` . In Razor files, you can use general HTML code. If you want to add C# code, add it in `@code { ... }`. An example from the index page is:

```razor
@page "/"
@inject HttpClient Http

<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to the counter.

<br>

<p role="status">Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

Reusable UI components are created as Razor components (.razor files). These are added in the Layout folder. Here you already find the navigation Razor file and the main layout from each page with their CSS files.

Services are configured in Program.cs and injected into components.

## How to start a C# program

To run a C# program, follow these steps.

### 1. Install .NET SDK

```bash
dotnet new console
```

### make your application

In Program.cs you can add your code to make your C# application.

An example of a project could be:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new Person
        {
            NameInCaps = "Firstname Lastname"
        });

        Console.WriteLine(new NewsItem
        {
            Title = "C# 13.0 is out!"
        });

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

public class Person
{
    private string field;

    public string NameInCaps
    {
        get => field;
        set => field = value.ToUpper();
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return NameInCaps;
    }
}

public class NewsItem
{
    private string field;

    public string Title
    {
        get => field;
        set => field = value;
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return field;
    }
}
```

### Run the program

Use these 2 commands in your terminal to run the program.

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

In the terminal you should see the output. In this example, it is:

```bash
LAUREN WILLE
C# 13.0 is out!
```
